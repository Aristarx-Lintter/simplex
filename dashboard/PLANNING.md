# Dashboard Planning Document

This document outlines key decisions and considerations before implementing the activation analysis dashboard.

## Key Decisions Needed

### 1. Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**:
  - Options: Streamlit, Dash, Gradio, custom React/Vue.js
  - Considerations: Ease of implementation, interactivity requirements, deployment constraints

- **Visualization Libraries**:
  - Options: Plotly, Matplotlib, Bokeh, Altair, D3.js
  - Considerations: Interactivity, customization needs, performance with large datasets

- **Backend Requirements**:
  - Data processing: Python/Pandas vs. distributed processing (if datasets are very large)
  - API requirements: REST, GraphQL, or direct file access

### 2. Core Visualizations

Based on the data structure, these visualizations would be most valuable:

- **Layer-wise Representation Quality**:
  - Heatmap of R-squared values across layers and checkpoints
  - Comparison with random baseline

- **Training Progress**:
  - Line plots of loss metrics over time (epochs/tokens)
  - Correlation between loss and representation quality

- **Architecture Comparison**:
  - Bar charts comparing different architectures (RNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformer)
  - Performance across different tasks (mess3, rrxor, etc.)

- **Layer Dynamics**:
  - How representation quality evolves across training checkpoints
  - Per-layer visualization of representation development

### 3. Data Loading & Processing

- **Data Discovery**:
  - How to automatically discover available sweeps and runs
  - Metadata parsing and organization

- **Preprocessing**:
  - What transformations are needed before visualization
  - Caching strategy for improved performance

- **Memory Constraints**:
  - Strategy for handling large CSV files
  - Progressive loading vs. full dataset loading

### 4. User Experience & Interaction

- **Dashboard Layout**:
  - Single page vs. multi-page application
  - Fixed vs. customizable layout

- **Filter & Selection Mechanisms**:
  - How users select sweeps, runs, layers, checkpoints
  - Filter persistence across visualizations

- **Comparison Tools**:
  - Side-by-side comparisons of different runs
  - Differential visualization capabilities

- **Export & Sharing**:
  - Export visualizations as images/PDFs
  - Sharing specific views/configurations

### 5. Implementation Phases

Consider a phased approach to dashboard development:

1. **Phase 1**: Basic data loading and core visualizations
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced interactivity and comparison tools
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced analytics, custom views, and export capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Decide on the technology stack
2. Create mockups of key visualizations
3. Implement data loading and basic visualization components
4. Build out the dashboard UI
5. Add interactivity and advanced features
6. Test with real data and refine

## Implementation Considerations

- **Maintainability**: Clear code organization and documentation
- **Extensibility**: Ability to add new visualizations or data types
- **Performance**: Efficient data loading and rendering
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface and consistent design
