# Epsilon Transformers

This project contains Python code for generating process data and training transformer models on it. The codebase is organized into several Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

## Codebase Structure

- `src/processes.py`: Contains the [Process](file:///c%3A/Users/adamimos/Documents/GitHub/epsilon-transformers/src/processes.py#9%2C7-9%2C7) parent class for generating process data, and several child classes for specific processes like [RRXORProcess](file:///c%3A/Users/adamimos/Documents/GitHub/epsilon-transformers/src/processes.py#144%2C7-144%2C7).
- `src/simple_transformer.py`: Contains the implementation of a simple transformer model.
- `src/markov_utilities.py`: Contains utility functions for working with Markov processes and epsilon machines.
- `notebooks/RRXOR_process.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for generating RRXOR process data and training a transformer on it.

## Usage

First, import the necessary classes from `processes.py`:
